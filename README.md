## Usage

[Downloads for macOS, Linux and Windows](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/hanmatek-hm310p/releases/latest)

Lookup the serial port of the HM310P USB interface, on macOS e.g. `/dev/tty.wchusbserial14121130`. Open the application and paste the serial port in _Tools > Settings > Port_.

Linux Users: Don't forget to give your user access to the serial port, on Ubuntu this can be done by adding your user to the dialout group: `sudo usermod -a -G dialout <username>`


## Contributing

Pull requests welcome! Clone the repo, do `npm install` in the project root. Use `npm start` to start the application in debug mode. Build with `npm run dist`.


## Todo/Ideas
