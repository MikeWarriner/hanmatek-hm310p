# Hidden Men

The HM305P and HM310P power supplies feature a Hidden menu. This menu is used for diagnostic
purposes and for setting up communication parameters between the unit and computer software. As
such, this menu and these settings should not be modified under normal circumstances. However, the
hidden menu does incorporate an option to turn the button Beep On and Off which can be useful. Here
are the instructions for this feature.  
  
**Note**: This is not difficult, just follow these instructions exactly and do not make any other setting
changes.  
  
To enter the hidden menu make sure the unit is first powered off, then power on the unit by first
holding down the **ON/OFF power output button** (item 4) then then press the Power switch (item 5).  
  
The unit will now power on and display an “Addr” option. The menu keys **M3**, **M4**, **M5 **and **M6 **will be lit.
The next option is the “beeP’ option and we select it by pressing the **ON/OFF power output button**
(item 4) one time. The display now shows the option “bEEP” on the display with the current “ON” or
“OFF” status, and the **M4 **button is lit. Press the **M4 **button to toggle the “bEEP” ON and OFF as you
desire. When you have the ON/OFF setting you require displayed simply power the unit off using **Power**
**switch** (item 5).  
  
If you make a mistake and get lost in the menus then power the unit off using the Power switch (item 5)
and try again.
